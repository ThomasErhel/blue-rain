## About
This project creates a rain animation on a canvas using p5.js library. The symbols in the animation are randomly selected from a set of Katakana characters and binary digits.

You can also use sliders to change the background color of the animation in real-time.

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Open the index.html file in a web browser to run the program
- Use the sliders to change the background color

## Customization

You can customize the animation by changing the following variables in the **sketch.js** file:

- symbolSize determines the size of the symbols in the animation
- fadeInterval determines the speed at which the symbols fade out
- speed determines the speed at which the symbols fall

You can also modify the symbols used in the animation by changing the **setToRandomSymbol** method in the **RainSymbol** class.
